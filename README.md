## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? 
 
- Provide a brief introduction to the project. Define the problem statement/ business question that this project will show and why it is important.
- Write in bullet point format

 _Example:_

 This project analyzes sales trends and inventory control using SQL and Power BI. The objective is
 
✔️ Analyze domestic overnight tourism performance in Australia between 2019–2025, covering Trips, Nights, and Spend.

✔️ Compare state-level performance vs national trends to identify which regions are growing or declining. 

✔️ Provide visual insights (KPI cards, line trends, maps, bar charts) to make patterns easy to interpret for decision-makers.

✔️ Support Tourism Department in identifying priority states, monitoring performance, and guiding strategic initiatives.

### 👤 Who is this project for?  

✔️ Data analysts & business analysts  

✔️ State and Federal Tourism Agencies: to track recovery trends, growth opportunities, and competitive positioning across Australia.

✔️ Policy Makers and Planners: to identify which regions need support or investment in tourism infrastructure and marketing.

✔️ Industry Stakeholders (e.g., hotels, airlines, tour operators): to align business strategies with demand shifts in Trips, Nights, and Spend. 

✔️ Researchers and Analysts: to study domestic tourism patterns and evaluate long-term impacts of external shocks (e.g., COVID-19).

- Format: (.csv, .sql, .xlsx, etc.)  

### 📊 Data Structure & Relationships  

#### 1️⃣ Tables Used:  
Mention how many tables are in the dataset.  

#### 2️⃣ Table Schema & Data Snapshot  

Table 1: Products Table  

👉🏻 Insert a screenshot of table schema. if table is too long, only show a snapshot of it. Recommend to put it in a toggle format

 _Example:_

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |  
|-------------|----------|-------------|  
| Product_ID  | INT      | Unique identifier for each product |  
| Name        | TEXT     | Product name |  
| Category    | TEXT     | Product category |  
| Price       | FLOAT    | Price per unit |  



Table 2: Sales Transactions  

👉🏻 Insert a screenshot of table schema. if table is too long, only show a snapshot of it. Recommend to put it in a toggle format


 _Example:_

| Column Name    | Data Type | Description |  
|---------------|----------|-------------|  
| Transaction_ID | INT      | Unique identifier for each sale |  
| Product_ID     | INT      | Foreign key linking to Products table |  
| Quantity       | INT      | Number of items sold |  
| Sale_Date      | DATE     | Date of transaction |
